# Keyword Extraction Python Code

Welcome to this repository! Here, you'll find Python code that's designed to extract the most important words from various types of texts, articles, and scientific research papers. The process of keyword extraction involves identifying key words or phrases that capture the essence of the content, making it easier to understand the main themes and topics of an article.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project on your own computer, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install NLTK Library:** NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful library for working with human language data. You can install it using the following command:
```bash
pip install nltk
```

2. **Install re:** The `re` library is Python's built-in regular expression library, which is used for pattern matching and text manipulation. It's usually pre-installed with Python.

3. **Install Scikit-learn Library:** Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides tools for data analysis and modeling. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

4. **Edit the `main.py` File:** Open the `main.py` file and locate the `text` variable. Replace the content with your own article or text that you want to extract keywords from. Save the file after making the changes.

5. **Run the Code:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Run the following command to execute the code:
```bash
python main.py
```
